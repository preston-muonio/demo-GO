# Demo-GO
This repository is for storing some of my first Golang programs.

I am learning go so this will contain programs related to expirementing, testing, and learning.

##1: Using Github
The first thing I learned about was git hub
This is part of that where I am changing the read me from VScode. I have already learned about reposotories, commits, and some other git basics. 

##2: Using Go
I started by watching a tutorial "learning go in 12 minutes". I went of on a tangent when learning about arrays. I ended up making a simple 3x3 array you could input a point onto.
