# Demo-GO
This repository is for storing some of my first proggrams.

It will be for all types of go proggrams.
It is for learning, testing and expirementing.

##1: Using Github
The first thing I learned about was git hub
This is part of that where I am changing the read me from VScode. I have already learned about reposotories, commits, and some other git basics. One thing I had trouble with was clones. I had been using ssh and it wasnt working. I looked into the problem and decided to scrap those and use https, which worked great!
